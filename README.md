# Filechecker

This python script will monitor your important files every 10 minutes and log if any changes has occured to the file by calculating the SHA256 hashing method and if the file gets deleted it will aslo log that.

Below are some images on how these work:
There will be two files create the one with **hash_values.json** will hold the respective hash value of the file and **integrity_logs.txt** will hold the logs of deletion or any modification done to those files with the file name and name.
